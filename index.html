        <div class="reviews">
            <p class="review1">"I found the online classes really flexible and as I live in a rural town it made it
                really
                easy to
                attend" - John B. (Junior Certificate) </p>
            <p class="review2">"I had twins sitting the Leaving Certificate together, the online group classes really
                helped as they
                could both attend together" Mary C. (Parent)</p>
            <p class="review3">"I would have been lost without them! Really well paced classes and really helpful!" -
                Jane
                O'R. (Leaving
                Certificate)</p>
            <p class="review4">"My son struggled in school after missing some time off, he really thrived after
                attending
                Doctrina!" -
                Michael S. (Parent)</p>
            <p class="review1">"Online Grinds are the way to go, I could access all my notes from home and they worked
                around my
                schedule" - Susan S. (Leaving Certificate)</p>
            <p class="review2">"I did the online group grinds, the class was really small and it helped build my
                confidence
                before the
                exams" - John S. (Junior Certificate)</p>
            <p class="review2">"We had done a lot of online classes in school, so it was really easy to get used to and
                I
                made a few new
                friends!" - Jack M. (Junior Certificate)</p>
            <p class="review4">"Was one of the best decisions we could have made! Really affordable and delighted with
                the
                results!" -
                Mary & John S. (Parent) </p>
            <p class="review3">"I would give it an A+!" - Sarah P. (Leaving Certificate)</p>
