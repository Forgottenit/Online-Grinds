# Design Choices
## Fonts
On this site I used the Google Font Slabo 13px after experimenting with different styles.  I felt this had a “Code” like appearance which alluded to the fact that the service is provided online. This was coupled with the standard GitHub font Courier New, as the Slabo font was mainly to signify the “branding” and may have complicated the standard font for form submissions and would have appeared over-styled. As the Heading of each page includes the name of the site, I felt this gave a striking style and although I debated inserting a “Logo” instead, I preferred this look due to the nature of the website, I thought brand awareness outweighed the visual appeal of a Logo. Although, this could be changed in the future.
## Icons
I used FontAwesome for logos for Social Media sites as these are industry standards and easily recognisable.

## Colours
The colours I chose for the fonts #f4a162;(orange) and #3f6c51 (green) for the website were, along with the white background, to be representative of the nature of the company being an Irish company, so to have a green white and gold colouring. The colours for the testimonials were bright to indicate positivity. The form submission backgrounds were a linear mix of the orange and green, with a transparency to not block out the background images matching the images from the landing page, to give a level of visual consistency.

## Structure
The website was built with a Breakpoint of 450px, below this point the Nav menu is made smaller and the border box removed to fit neater on the page, also, the form lengths are increased as to have a neater content.

# Features
## Existing Features

-	The Nav Bar includes links to form submissions, the style is changed below 450px width as to give a neater view on smaller screens. It contains a Home link, links to Junior Cert and Leaving Cert option submission forms and a link for Teachers to sign up to a apply to be Tutors for the Website.
### Landing page

This contains links to Social Media sites that open in a new page, namely, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. This links all open on a new page.

## Submission Forms
Junior Cert, Leaving Cert and Teacher Submission forms. Each has a background, covered by the form in a transparent view. The Junior and Leaving Cert forms contain Checkboxes to select classes from the relevant cycles, the Teacher Submission form contains a text area box to submit a Cv. All three contain inputs for First Name, Last Name and Email, these are all set to required.

# Future Features 
-	Forms to submit to an accessible database that could be collected
-	Examined the option of having a "Burger" menu on the Nav Bar, but I felt I would be more comfortable implementing this with JavaScript
